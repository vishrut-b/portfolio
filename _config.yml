description: "I am a recent master's graduate in Astrophysics and Data Science from the University of Strasbourg, with a particular interest in ML/AI solutions. Apart from painting, singing and occassionally hitting the gym, I have a specific range of topics I like to read about (evolutionary biology/psychology, ancient history and political science, but I like it the most when all of them converge.)."
